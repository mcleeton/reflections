When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Using a remote repository allows you to have access to your work from other work spaces, computers, or device than what your work is locally stored on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It is best practice to pull changes manually to ensure that any local changes you have made since your last 'push' will not be removed when you sync your local and remote repositories.
