What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository will create an empty git repository (a .git directory with a few subdirectories). An initial Head file that references the head of the master branch is also created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area lets you manipulate more than one file before committing a current 'snapshot' of your project. By manipulating that staging area you can control what files are included (or excluded) from a given commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Using the staging area properly (by using 'git add' when modifying the file for each logical component) will allow you to create commits for only those files you modify, and essentially help isolate/describe logical changes. Using these features properly will help create more logical divisions to changes in the code.
