What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository will create an empty git repository (a .git directory with a few subdirectories). An initial Head file that references the head of the master branch is also created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area lets you manipulate more than one file before committing a current 'snapshot' of your project. By manipulating that staging area you can control what files are included (or excluded) from a given commit.
